# External validation #1c — per-axis DEB rates ↔ demographic resilience (Idea B)

*Working note, 2026-06-12. Idea B of the roadmap. Tests the pre-registered mapping
(`comadre_peraxis_prereg.md`, frozen before computing): do distinct DEB process
rates predict distinct COMADRE demographic-resilience components? This is the test
of the **margin-first multi-dimensional** claim, vs. the scalar `k_M`↔recovery
result. Reproduce: `scripts/extract_comadre_recovery.jl` (now also reactivity +
attenuation) → `scripts/extract_amp_reproduction_rates.jl` →
`examples/comadre_peraxis_validation.jl`. n=197 species (193 with generation time).*

## Metrics
- **Model rates** (AmP, ref T, log): `k_M` maintenance, `R_i` ultimate reproduction,
  `r_B` von Bertalanffy growth.
- **Demographic** (COMADRE `matA`, Â=A/λ₁, Stott et al. 2011, log₁₀):
  recovery = damping ratio; compensation = reactivity (max col sum); resistance =
  attenuation (min col sum).

## Result — gen-controlled partial rank correlations

| rate \ component | resistance | compensation | recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `k_M` (maint.) | +0.313 ** | −0.300 ** | +0.260 ** |
| `R_i` (repro.) | −0.597 ** | **+0.773 \*\*** | −0.092 |
| `r_B` (growth) | +0.524 ** | −0.590 ** | +0.326 ** |

(Raw correlations show the same pattern; R_i→compensation is +0.739 raw, +0.773
gen-controlled, **+0.775 controlling generation time AND body mass `Ww_i`**.)

**Pre-registered prediction outcomes:**
- **P1 PASS** — `R_i`'s strongest component is **compensation** (+0.773).
- **P1b PASS** — compensation's strongest rate is **`R_i`** (vs −0.30 `k_M`, −0.59 `r_B`).
- **P2b PASS** — recovery's strongest rate is `r_B` (+0.326; within pred. k_M-or-r_B).
- **P2 fail** — `k_M`'s strongest component is resistance (+0.313) just above recovery
  (+0.260); both significant and positive, but not the predicted column-max.

## What it means
1. **The per-axis structure is real and strong — the reproduction axis maps to the
   compensation component.** `R_i`→compensation (+0.77, robust to pace and size) is
   the single strongest association in the entire COMADRE validation, far exceeding
   any scalar recovery correlation. The multi-dimensional margin-first claim has
   genuine external support: which DEB process is impaired predicts *which kind* of
   demographic resilience, not just an undifferentiated rate.
2. **`k_M`/`r_B` sit at the persistence end.** Maintenance and growth rates predict
   **resistance** and **recovery** positively and **compensation** negatively — the
   slow/persistent pole. `k_M`'s recovery signal (+0.26**) replicates the scalar
   result on this table, though resistance edges it (P2 "fail" is marginal).
3. **The dominant structure is a resistance↔compensation trade-off, and the rates
   sort along it.** Resistance and compensation are near-mirror images (`R_i`: −0.60
   / +0.77; `r_B`: +0.52 / −0.59). Recovery (damping) is the more independent third
   component. So the data resolve a coherent fast-reproduction (compensation) vs
   slow-maintenance/growth (resistance) axis, with recovery partly orthogonal —
   exactly a multi-axis picture, not one scalar.

## The honest caveat (must accompany the headline)
**The `R_i`↔compensation link is partly mechanical.** Reactivity (max column sum of
Â) is dominated by the fertility (`matF`) entries, and `R_i` is a fecundity rate —
both are "reproductive output," so a correlation is expected by construction. What is
*not* tautological: `R_i` is predicted from the DEB **energy budget** ({p_Am, κ, v,
…}, lab/reference conditions) while COMADRE reactivity comes from **independent field
projection matrices**. A 0.77 rank match across aphids→whales, holding pace and body
size, therefore validates that **DEB-predicted reproduction tracks field
reproductive demography** — a meaningful cross-dataset correspondence, but it is a
convergent measurement of fecundity, not proof of an emergent abstract "margin." The
manuscript must frame it as the former. (The `k_M`/`r_B`↔resistance/recovery cells
are less mechanically coupled and so carry more independent weight, but are weaker.)

## Robustness — is reproduction↔compensation more than raw fecundity?
The strongest cell (`R_i`↔reactivity) is partly mechanical. To test whether the map
survives beyond raw fecundity *magnitude*, three further reproduction descriptors,
all generation-time-controlled (n=193):

| predictor → compensation | partial rank ρ | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a_p` (timing) \| gen | +0.359 ** | reproduction timing, *not* a fecundity count |
| `R_i/Ww_i` (mass-specific) \| gen | +0.628 ** | size-free fecundity |
| `R_i` \| gen, **a_p** | +0.793 ** | fecundity magnitude survives timing control |
| `a_p` \| gen, **R_i** | +0.442 ** | timing survives fecundity-magnitude control |

(`kap_R` not tested: AmP default 0.95 for ~97% of species — no variance.)

**This substantially allays the mechanical concern.** Two *distinct, non-redundant*
reproduction descriptors each independently predict compensation beyond pace: (i)
mass-specific fecundity (+0.63 — so not merely body-size magnitude), and (ii)
reproduction timing `a_p`, whose link to reactivity is **not** mechanical and which
survives controlling fecundity magnitude (+0.44). So the reproduction→compensation
correspondence is a real, multi-faceted reproduction-strategy signal, not reducible
to the single `R_i`↔reactivity fecundity-count identity — though that strongest cell
retains a mechanical component.

**Pre-registration deviation — RESOLVED (2026-06-12).** I pre-registered
`a_p`→compensation as *negative* (later puberty → less compensation); it came out
**positive** (+0.36). A dedicated diagnostic (`scripts/comadre_ap_diagnostic.jl`,
controlling for pace, fecundity, body mass, and matrix dimension) explains it:
- `a_p` is strongly **pace-loaded** (ρ(`a_p`, gen) = +0.50). The negative intuition
  lives entirely in pace (slow species compensate less) and is removed by the gen control.
- `a_p` is **not** a fecundity proxy (ρ(`a_p`, `R_i`) = −0.13, mildly inverse), so it
  is not re-testing `R_i`; the suppression (effect grows to +0.44 controlling `R_i`)
  follows from that mild negative `a_p`–`R_i` correlation.
- It is **not a matrix-dimension artifact**: ρ(dimension, compensation) = +0.001, and
  the partial barely moves under a dimension control (+0.443 → +0.411).
- The effect survives controlling pace, fecundity, mass, *and* dimension (+0.43).

So within a pace class, **delayed maturity independently predicts greater demographic
compensation** — a genuine reproduction-*timing* axis distinct from fecundity
magnitude. The pre-registered sign was wrong because it conflated pace with strategy;
the residual-after-pace signal is robustly positive. Net: the reproduction *axis* maps
to the compensation *component* through two independent facets (magnitude `R_i` and
timing `a_p`), strengthening the per-axis result.

## Verdict
**The pre-registered core passed: the reproduction axis specifically and robustly
predicts the compensation component** — the first multi-dimensional external result,
and stronger than anything scalar. The mechanical-coupling caveat for the headline
cell is **substantially mitigated** by the robustness checks: size-free fecundity and
(non-mechanical) reproduction timing both independently predict compensation. The
maintenance/growth↔resistance/recovery side is directionally as predicted but weaker
and noisier. Next: (i) carry the dated phylogeny (Idea A TODO) through to this matrix;
(ii) resolve the positive-`a_p` interpretation; (iii) decide which cells are
manuscript-grade given the coupling audit.
