# External validation #1 — COMADRE demographic recovery

*Working note, 2026-06-12. The first **external** anchor for the framework (all
prior checks were internal). Tests whether the model's recovery quantities predict
independent demographic recovery from the COMADRE animal matrix database, **beyond
raw pace-of-life** — the generation-time-controlled partial correlation that
`external_anchor_scouting.md` identified as the only clean test. Reproduce:
`scripts/extract_comadre_recovery.jl` (extraction) →
`scripts/resolve_comadre_amp_names.jl` (name harmonisation) →
`examples/comadre_partial_validation.jl` (analysis).*

## Method

- **COMADRE recovery** = log₁₀ damping ratio `|λ1|/|λ2|` of each wild, unmanipulated
  projection matrix (rate of return to stable structure), aggregated per species.
- **Control** = Caswell generation time `log R0 / log λ1`, computed from the same
  matrices (so the control is independent of AmP).
- **Model quantities** (from AmP): `λ(A0)` pristine recovery rate, `λ_min = k_M`
  (maintenance rate constant), and `g = λ_max/λ_min` (the amplification axis).
- Species matched via the **harmonised name map** (`scripts/resolve_comadre_amp_names.jl`:
  exact → COMADRE duplicated-genus-typo fix → trinomial→binomial → GBIF Backbone
  synonym/accepted-name resolution). This recovers 15 species lost to exact-string
  matching (synonyms like *Rana*→*Lithobates*, reclassifications, spelling). Multiple
  COMADRE names resolving to one AmP species are collapsed (their COMADRE quantities
  averaged) to avoid pseudoreplication. **197 species matched; 193 with generation
  time** (was 183/179 under exact matching).
- Three nested controls: raw Spearman; partial controlling generation time
  (pace-of-life); and **Order-controlled** — within taxonomic Orders
  (group-mean-centered) *and* controlling generation time, a tree-free proxy for
  PGLS (174 species across 30 multi-species Orders).

## Result

| model quantity | raw ρ | \| gen. time | \| gen. time **+ Order** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `λ(A0)` recovery rate | +0.362 ** | +0.173 * | +0.089 (n.s.) |
| `λ_min = k_M` | +0.406 ** | +0.264 ** | **+0.190 \*** |
| `g` (amplification axis) | −0.109 | −0.128 | −0.055 (n.s.) |

(*p<0.05, **p<0.01; n=197, 193 with generation time.) Reference:
ρ(COMADRE recovery, generation time) = −0.399. The result is **stable under name
harmonisation** — the larger, synonym-corrected sample reproduces the n=183 finding
(`k_M` within-Order partial 0.190* vs 0.200*), so the signal is not an artifact of
which species happened to match by exact string.

## What it means

1. **First external corroboration — and it's positive.** Species the model says
   recover faster (higher `λ(A0)`, higher `k_M`) genuinely have faster demographic
   return-to-equilibrium in COMADRE (raw ρ ≈ 0.36–0.40).
2. **The phylogenetic control sharpens, rather than kills, the signal.** The
   maintenance rate constant **`k_M` survives the strongest test** — within
   taxonomic Order *and* controlling generation time (ρ=0.200*). So `k_M` predicts
   demographic recovery **beyond both pace-of-life and coarse phylogeny**. `λ(A0)`'s
   broader signal was largely *between*-clade (it drops to a non-significant 0.095
   under the Order control), i.e. mostly phylogenetic.
3. **The `g` amplification axis is *not* corroborated at any control level**
   (partial ρ ≈ −0.1, n.s.) — orthogonal to demographic recovery, echoing the
   life-history check. The external data validates the **recovery/margin** half of
   the model — specifically the DEB maintenance rate constant — not the **`F`/`g`
   amplification scalar**. Direct support for the margin-first reframe.

## Caveats (honest)

- **Scale bridge.** COMADRE recovery is *population* demographic (damping ratio per
  projection interval); the model's `λ` is *individual-energetic* (per day). Rank
  correlation is unit-invariant, but the individual→population bridge is assumed
  (defensible via DEB, not 1:1).
- **Modest magnitudes.** Partial ρ ≈ 0.17–0.26 — significant at n=193 but a small
  effect; this is corroboration, not strong prediction.
- **Specification-sensitive (important).** The gen-controlled `k_M` signal is
  **rank-based**: partial *Spearman* `k_M~recovery|gen` = +0.264, but the
  log-linear (Pearson) partial is only +0.04. So it is monotone-but-not-log-linear
  — a real result under rank assumptions, but it does not survive a linear
  PGLS/OLS regression control. See `comadre_pgls_validation.md` (Idea A).
- **Matrix-quality filtering** (wild, unmanipulated, primitive matrices) introduces
  noise. Species matching is now GBIF-harmonised (197/286 matched). The remaining
  89 unresolved are species genuinely absent from AmP, not name mismatches: ~39 are
  congeners (AmP has the genus but a different species), ~50 are whole genera/clades
  absent from AmP (corals, sponges, some molluscs/polychaetes).

## Verdict

The recovery-capacity framing has its **first independent validation signal that
survives both pace-of-life and coarse-phylogeny controls** — carried specifically
by the DEB maintenance rate constant `k_M` (within-Order partial ρ=0.20*). The
amplification scalar `g`/`F` does not. This is corroboration, not strong
prediction, but it is the cleanest external evidence to date and it points squarely
at the margin/recovery layer rather than the amplification readout. Next refinements
if pursued: (a) a real phylogeny (Open Tree of Life) + PGLS instead of the
taxonomic-rank proxy, (b) a per-axis margin recovery metric rather than `λ(A0)`,
(c) sensitivity to the matrix-quality filters.
